    <p> Epic Games is a great place to start. Not only is it home to the imfamous fortnite but they also give a free game every week and even though they arent always the best games, they will allow you to build up your game library, and before you ask
        the games you get from epic games will stay yours so get them while their still avaliable.
        So if your like me and dont really like spending money on games then Epic Games is surely for you. <br>
        To find the free games you must log onto epic games and scroll down till you see the title free games there it will not only show you what games are currently free, but also games that will be coming free in the near future.
    </p>

    <h1 id="steam" ><u> Steam</u></h1>
    <img id="steam" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nAN_mfhRhpXykgpVCM3gz_ZSZdU=/289x0:1711x800/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55123047/steam_logo_art_2000.0.jpg" alt="steam"

        <br>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike Epic Games, Steam has games that they have for free but they do not do weekly giveaways.  They will howerver add more games on the free list so you won't see the same games every time
        you log on.  Plus they usually have deals on games that Epic Games gives out for free if you dont like Epic Games. They have a large choice of free games to choose from and also demos for you to try out inase
        theres a game you are looking into buying.

    <h1 id="xbox"> <u> Xbox Live</u></h1>

    <br>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Xbox Live Gold is actually what you pay for when you buy xbox live.  With gold you are given 3 free games every month and each game could range from being xbox one or even as old as the origional xbox.
        You never really know what to expect with gold but no matter what those 3 free games is a for sure gift from xbox.
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; If you own an xbox all you have to do is scroll down till you see memberships and look for the gold membership, after that you get to see the games with gold that their giving out at that time.
    </p>

    <h1 id="ps"> <u>Playstation Live</u></h1>

    <br>
    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Same as Xbox, Playstation alse gives out free games every month as long as you have a Playstation Live membership, the games are randomly given same as xbox so you just have to check every month to
        see what games there are. They also have free games already in the game store if you dont quite know what to play while you wait for the next game to come out.
